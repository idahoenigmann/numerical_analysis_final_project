Cholesky decomposition algorithm of skyline matrices

Python implementation of conversion from numpy matrices to specialized skyline matrix data structure and improved cholesky decomposition based on this data structure.

Documentation including proof well definedness of the algorithm; best, average and worst case performace and possible improvements for skyline matrices of specialized forms.

Note: this algorithm performs way worse than numpy.linalg.cholesky! If you are searching for faster alternatives you should continue your search (good luck!).
